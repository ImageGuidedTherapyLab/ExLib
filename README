USAGE:

   crlSTAPLE  [-b <optional beta parameter>] [-a <optional alpha
              parameter>] [-m] [--assignConsensusVoxels <Determines if
              voxels with label estimates that are the same amongst all
              inputs are assigned directly or used in the computation.>]

              <optional: Controls computation with none, some, or extremely
              extended precision. Useful with large numbers of input
              segmentations.>] [-f <optional: file Dimensionality (2 for 2D
              , 3 for 3D)>] [--initialExpertPerformance <optional: Provide
              the initial on-diagonal performance parameter for each input
              segmentation.>] [-s <optional: Provide the stationary prior
              for each tissue class label from 0 to the largest in the
              input files.>] -o <Output Image File Name> [--] [--version]

Please find attached a script for Linux or Mac OS X that will download, build and install version 1.5.2 of CRKit, including STAPLE. The implementation is based on the paper by (Warfield, Zou, Wells IEEE TMI 2004) and can be acknowledged in a publication by citing the paper and including the following text:

This research was supported in part by NIH R01 RR021885 from the National Center for Research Resources, and by an award from the Neuroscience Blueprint I/C through R01 EB008015 from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

The software is designed to operate as a command line tool, with a graphical user interface for visualization.

An example of using crlSTAPLE to analyse segmentations of the prostate is included in this directory: apps/staple/data/prostate/staple and other examples with synthetic phantoms are included.

A detailed tutorial description of how to use the software is available in the distribution and online here:

http://www.crl.med.harvard.edu/software/TutorialIntroductionToSTAPLE.pdf


Let me know if you have any questions using the software.

The software requires some time and disk space to build successfully. Let me know if you prefer a binary distribution for Linux, Mac OS X or Windows.
