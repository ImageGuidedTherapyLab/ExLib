compile_me    % command for compiling the C code

main.c  % example call of genus0().  Read it (and genus0.h) for more info.

genus0.c    % the code
genus0.h    % header file.  Read it for information on calling genus0()
tricases.h  % header file for Marching Cubes

MakeTorus.m       % makes a torus as a binary image volume (for testing)
MakeTorus2.m      % makes another torus as a binary image volume

ShowSurf.m  % shows the resulting surface.  Writes OutSurf.vtk too.
ShowVol.m   % shows adjusted binaray volume

imv.m       % pretty much the same as matlab image() function
ts.m        % pretty much the same as matlab trisurf() function
write_vtk.m % writes a vtk triagulated surface model

Run compile_me, then run a.exe or a.out, then run ShowSurf and ShowVol to
look at the result.
