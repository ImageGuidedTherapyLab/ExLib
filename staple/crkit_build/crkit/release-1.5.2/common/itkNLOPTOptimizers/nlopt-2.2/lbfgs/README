Limited-memory BFGS code by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Peihuang Lu, and
Jorge Nocedal, which can be found (in various translations) at various
online sites:

Unfortunately, since it was published in ACM TOMS, it seems to be
under the restrictive (semi-free) ACM copyright conditions.  This was
confirmed in a private email from the author, Prof. Nocedal.

Therefore, we no longer use this code in NLopt.

Fortunately, Prof. Luksan's PLIN.FOR code (see the luksan/ directory)
is an independent implementation of the same algorithm, and is licensed
under the LGPL.
