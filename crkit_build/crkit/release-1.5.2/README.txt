The Computational Radiology toolkit (CRKit) implements research carried out 
in the Computational Radiology Laboratory of Children's Hospital, Boston and 
Harvard Medical School. The goal of CRKit is to enable quantitative analysis 
of MRI of the developing brain by providing a software package that implements
proven, validated algorithms with a user-friendly graphical user interface to
enable end users to easily apply these methods. This software is distributed
as open source software in order to create a platform for scientific discovery
and to facilitate clinical and translational research.

Accurate and robust quantitative assessment of pediatric MRI is a challenging 
task because the developing newborn brain poses unique challenges not apparent 
in older subjects, including significant age-dependent contrast properties of 
brain tissue, rapid microstructural and macrostructural changes, and 
spatial resolution of features of interest close to the limit of imaging 
resolution.  Addressing these challenges satisfactorily requires the unique 
expertise and methods and techniques we have developed over the past ten 
years and which are currently not available elsewhere.

This research work was made possible by Grant Number R01 RR021885 (Principal
Investigator: Simon K. Warfield, Ph.D.) to Children's Hospital, Boston
from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH).

describing the methods implemented in this software and by acknowledging
